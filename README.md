# PostgreSQL_ETL
A few simple transformation and extract commands in PostgreSQL.
Based off the sample DVD Rental database.
The point was to create a collective table with data and create functions to transform one of the fields from a date to a single number to represent an average. 
Then to get relevant customer information on sales and retention and put that into a shortened format for business analysis.
